# W-crypt

Demo Link: [https://wcrypt.netlify.app](https://wcrypt.netlify.app/)

Responsive React app that fetches real-time crypto token prices (in USD) using the Binance Websocket API.

Animated using the Framer Motion animation library, and deployed it on Netlify.com.

Implemented functionality to allow users to select different tokens (or use the search bar), enter the amount of money he/she wants to invest, and dynamically see how many tokens they will get after investment.
